* Introduction

Abacus is a header only library for arbitrary precision big number arithmetic computing. It is a toy project created with following objectives in my mind:

1. to practice my C++ programming skills
2. to learn mathematics, especially for encryption study I hope

As it is just for educational purpose, the implementation is unrestrained. Anyway, a bc compatible executive will be created as an application and benchmark test.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Your/Installation/Path/ ..
make
make install
#+END_SRC

* Progress

** DONE read integer digits and store them in base $2^{32}$
CLOSED: [2020-02-05 三 18:33]

** DONE display number in any base(0 ~ $2^{32}$)
CLOSED: [2020-02-05 三 18:36]

** DONE rewrite the implementation
CLOSED: [2020-03-11 Wed 14:11]

** DONE read and write decimal number
CLOSED: [2020-03-11 Wed 14:11]

** TODO basic arithmetic (add/sub/mul/div/mod)
